## Description
**_Personal Webpage to Help Showcase my Skill Set_** <br/>
My first html-css based webpage that I developed and published through GitHub pages. It contains information about my education, skills, and experience in the computer science field. The site theme is based off of my personal hobbies outside of programming. I have linked my GitHub and LinkedIn at the bottom of the page as well as included a button to help anyone get in contact with me.<br /><br />
